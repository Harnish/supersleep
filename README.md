### supersleep - sleep with output

This is a quick tool I use in replace of sleep so I can tell how much longer my sleep command has.  This is not 100% accurate.  It really doesn't matter to me for what I use it for.  

My main use is when I kick off a sleep command for multiple hours and come back later and want to know where it is at.  I could probably add different things but this was straight forward.  Maybe I should make it run like sleep but if you send it a signal it could change the view.
